# Databases II Project

This repository contains my Databases II Project applications, scripts and
documentation. The idea behind is to take a wrong-structured dataset from 
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) called
[home-credit-default-risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data)
and create a well-organized and efficient database. Also a web application 
to visualize some request to the database.

## Directories

- `app`: This folder holds the web application.
- `db`: The database SQL query.
- `diagrams`: Here is the ER & Relational model for the new database.
- `doc`: The project main documentation, in LaTeX.
- `migrator`: The dataset -> database migrator. Pending to select a method to do it.
- `dataset`: Folder that contains the dataset and initial diagram.
